# 🐄 SafeHerd — Protecting Livestock with Smart GPS Tech

SafeHerd is a low-cost, tech-based livestock tracking solution designed to combat animal theft in rural areas. Built by students and developers in Rwanda, SafeHerd combines GPS technology and mobile apps to protect farmers' most valuable assets — their animals.

## 🌱 Origin Story

As a software developer and student from Rwanda, I noticed a serious problem: many farmers in my community were losing their animals to theft. Physical fences and guards are too expensive or unreliable.

I wanted to create a simple, low-cost, and tech-based solution. That’s when I came up with the idea to use GPS and mobile phones to help farmers protect their livestock. It matters because it can save farmers from losing income and improve food security in rural areas.
